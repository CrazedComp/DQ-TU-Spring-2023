### Exercise 3.3.9 - Show that if $a$ and $b$ are integers, not both 0, and $c$ is a nonzero integer, then $gcd(ca,cb)=|c|gcd(a,b).$
$Proof:$



--- 
### Exercise 3.3.10 - Show that if $a$ and $b$ are integers, with $gcd(a,b)=1,$ then $gcd(a+b,a-b)=1 ~\lor~2.$ 
$Proof:$




--- 
### Exercise 3.3.17 - Find a set of three integers that are mutually relatively prime, but any two of which are not relatively prime. (No ex.'s from text)





--- 
### Exercise 3.3.24 - Show that if $k$ is a positive integer, then $3k+2$ and $5k+3$ are relatively prime.
$Proof:$
